        <h1 id="Chapter-2-Understanding-Student-Populations-and-Instructional-Contexts"><a href="#Chapter-2-Understanding-Student-Populations-and-Instructional-Contexts" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 2 Understanding Student Populations and Instructional Contexts"></a>Chapter 2 Understanding Student Populations and Instructional Contexts</h1><p>“ESL writers”: “a specific type of student, ususally an international (visa) student who had come to the US or another English-dominat region to complete his or her studies, or a recently arrived resident immigrant students. “</p>
<h2 id="L2-Writers-Understanding-Student-Populations"><a href="#L2-Writers-Understanding-Student-Populations" class="headerlink" title="L2 Writers: Understanding Student Populations"></a>L2 Writers: Understanding Student Populations</h2><p>L2 writers can be further divided into the following groups:</p>
<h3 id="International-Visa-Students"><a href="#International-Visa-Students" class="headerlink" title="International (Visa) Students"></a>International (Visa) Students</h3><p>International students travel to another country to study and usually (but not always) to complete an undergraduate or graduate degree, but not all international students are considered L2 writers, including those from Native English-speaking countries or countries with English as an official language, even international students whose language status is considered “not L2” after receiving an undergraduate degree from a U.S. university. International students would be considered “elective bilinguals” (Valdés, 1992) who choose to be bilingual for some kind of personal benefit. These students usually come from quite priviledged backgrounds are are well-educated and literate in their L1s. They are also “eye learners” (Reid, 1998) who have learned the L2 mainly through their eyes, studying vocabulary, verb forms, and language tules.</p>
<p>L2 writing is viewed and taught differently in the world. Reichelt (2011) surveyed research on foreign language writing instruction in a broad range of conexts, finding some secondary students are expected to complete demanding, high-level literacy tasks, while  in other contexts writing is viewed for the purpose of <em>writing to learn</em> rather than <em>learning to write</em>. Writing instructors can be further consrained by large class sizes, heavy teaching loads, and national testing or curriculum requirements (Foster &amp; Russell, 2002; Reicheit, 2011; You, 2006). The motivations and expectations of international students can also be different since some may have clear instrumental goals such as meeting minimum proficiency standards.</p>
<h3 id="EFL-Students"><a href="#EFL-Students" class="headerlink" title="EFL Students"></a>EFL Students</h3><p>Unlike ESL writing studies focus on “writing in English in English-dominant contexts,” FL writing “occurs around the world in a broad diversity of language and contexts” (Cimasko &amp; Reichelt, 2011). EFL learners are also described as  elective bilinguals and eye learners. However, FL classes are not truly elective as students in some countries are required to take English courses, and it would be an overgeneralization to assume all EFL learners are highly motivated to learn the L2. Both instructors and students feel constrained  and pressured by government-mandated examinations that prioritize specific types of language performance and resist other forms of instruction that do not seem to be so relevant to meeting the offical standards (Reichelt, 2011; You, 2002; Lee, 2009). EFL students tend to have well-established literacy practices and strategies that potentially can transfer to L2 reading and composing tasks. However, their L2 writing development may be influenced by the limited exposure to L2 reading and writing. </p>
<h3 id="Resident-Immigrants"><a href="#Resident-Immigrants" class="headerlink" title="Resident Immigrants"></a>Resident Immigrants</h3><p>Resident immigrants are those who have located, ususally permanently, to the new SL/L2 context. They may arrive and matriculate in schools at various points in the educational system, depending on family circumstances. Some of them are voluntary immigrants, coming to a new home for better professional or economic opportunities. Others are refugees who have been allowed to immigrate due to war, political or religious persecution. Those immigrants often rely on government assistance. Also, resident immigrants show great diversity in their educational experiences and language development. Depending on the circumstances behind their immigration, their education could have been interrupted and they may not have strong L1 literacy skills. Immigrant students are considered as circumstantial bilinguals (Valdés, 1992) and ear learners (Reid, 1988), meaning they have become bilingual from necessity rather than by their choice, and they learned the L2 in naturalistic settings than the formal L2 instruction in classrooms. </p>
<h3 id="Generation-1-5-Learners"><a href="#Generation-1-5-Learners" class="headerlink" title="Generation 1.5 Learners"></a>Generation 1.5 Learners</h3><p>“Generation 1.5” group refers to the U.S.-educated children of the first-generation immigrants (Harklau et al., 1999). In this book’s view, “Generation 1.5” is a label more descriptive of a student’s psychological and educational experiences than a trictly demographic one. According to Roberge (2009), this generation “has life experiences than span two or more countries, cultures, and languages” (p. 4) and has “a self-perception of in-beween-ness”.  Ferris and Hedgecock in this book argue that U.S.-born, second-generation immigrants  can also share the characteristics.  Generation 1.5 students are more assimilated to the border L2 culture and the educational system than other L2 writier groups mentioned before. They tend to be circumstantial and ear learners. Still, their late start in L2 development and non mainstream tracking may have continued to influence their experiences in secondary school. </p>
<h3 id="Literacy-Abilities-of-Different-L2-Populations"><a href="#Literacy-Abilities-of-Different-L2-Populations" class="headerlink" title="Literacy Abilities of Different L2 Populations"></a>Literacy Abilities of Different L2 Populations</h3><p>The following figure summarizes patterns of literacy development among the aforementioned groups of L2 writers. However, it will be counterproductive if we overgeneralize about different L2 groups. The book also shared real-life papers of four students  (Appendix 2).</p>

<p><strong>FIGURE 2.3</strong> Contexts for L2 writing instruction. Adapted from Hedgcock and Ferris (2009, p. 221).</p>
<h3 id="Foreign-Language-Contexts"><a href="#Foreign-Language-Contexts" class="headerlink" title="Foreign Language Contexts"></a>Foreign Language Contexts</h3><p>Issues FL instructors must investigate and consider include the following:</p>
<p><strong>Language and culture:</strong> crosslinguistic differences (including linguistic and retorical knowledge), cultural norms that can affect students’ responses to tasks, topics, and instructional approaches (e.g., peer response, textual borrowing, critical analysis of published text, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>L2 status and resources:</strong> attitudes towards English, avaliable resources in English</p>
<p><strong>Approaches to writing:</strong> how writing is viewed and used</p>
<p><strong>External expectations:</strong> national or local requirements, expectations of institutions and administrations</p>
<p><strong>Other practical issues:</strong> large class size, avaliable resources (Internet, projectors, etc.)</p>
<h3 id="Second-Language-Contexts"><a href="#Second-Language-Contexts" class="headerlink" title="Second Language Contexts"></a>Second Language Contexts</h3><p><em><strong>Nonacademic settings.</strong></em> Adult or vocational programs serve L2 students. Wrting activities reflect a predominant writing-to-learn orietation, which focus on structured tasks such as filling out forms and job applications. Teachers in these contexts should be aware that student populations in such courses tend to be transitory because of frequent turnover. Lessons should have immediate value and cannot easily build on prior units. Second, students in these courses may not have time for homework as they have other resposibilities out of class.</p>
<p><em><strong>Intensive language programs.</strong></em> ILPs are usually marginalized because they are funded largely through student fees rather than the university general budget. These include several distinct subtypes: 1. Developmental, remedial language, and literacy programs. 2. Preacademic language programs. 3. Short-term language or culture programs.</p>
<p><em><strong>Academic programs (secondary).</strong></em> School systems in the U.S. are learning to adapt to the more diverse student population. L2 teachers at secondary levels must be aware that factors such as self-confidence, identity, crosscultural conflict, and peer influence are extremely acute with this adolescent population. More attention should be devoted to the development of academic literacy by secondary L2 students and especially to their critical transition to postsecondary studies.</p>
<p><em><strong>Academic settings (post-secondary).</strong></em> </p>
<p><u>Two-year (community/junior) colleges:</u> Two-year colleges, especially in high immigration regions, offer extensive coursework for multilingual students, including multiple levels of literacy instruction and skill-specific courses in reading, grammar, and listening and speaking.</p>
<p><u>Four-year (undergraduate) colleges and universities</u>: L2 students can enroll in designated ESL courses at the developmental level, but they are mainstreamed with other (monolingual L1) undergraduates once they reach college-level writing instruction. It is unusual to find many course offerings for L2 undergraduates in language skills other than writing.</p>
<p><u>Writing in the disciplines:</u>  Specialists in writing across the curriculum (WAC) and writing in the disciplines (WID) can both work collaboratively with L2 writing experts and pursue more training themselves so that disciplinary faculty can become better equipped to work with increasingly diverse student populations.</p>
<p><u>Graduate and professional programs in universities:</u> Some international students may struggle with thesis or dissertation supervisors who do not have the time, interest, or expertise to help their L2 advisees with their writing.</p>
<p><u>Support services:</u> </p>

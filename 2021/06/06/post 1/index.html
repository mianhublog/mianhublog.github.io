        <p><em>Writing is the most important technology in the history of the human species, except how to make a fire. (Powell, 2012, p.11)</em> </p>
<p>The first chapter of this book is to lay a foundation of historical precedents, theoretical principles, and research-based models, so readers can build sufficient knowledge to make informed decisions about the pedagogical methods, processes, and strategies introduced in the practice-oriented chapters that will be summarized later in this blog. </p>

<h2 id="Theoretical-knowledge-in-L2-writing-instruction-and-research"><a href="#Theoretical-knowledge-in-L2-writing-instruction-and-research" class="headerlink" title="Theoretical knowledge in L2 writing instruction and research"></a>Theoretical knowledge in L2 writing instruction and research</h2><p>Ferris and Hedgcock first examined the intellectual and practical value of the theoretical knowledge in composition instruction. How we understand writing process and the best methods for teaching writing is disparate and continue to shift (Polio &amp;Williams, 2011; Silva &amp; Brice, 2004), so teachers need to consequently consider a wide range of approaches, underlying assumptions, and the practices generated by each philosophy (Raimes, 1991). Knowledge of formal models, theories, and methods enables teachers to discover their own theories (Grabe &amp; Kaplan, 1997; Hedgcock, 2002; Kumaravadivelu, 2012; Yates &amp; Muchisky, 2003). Explicit, formal knowledge helps teachers promote an appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of their own skills, become critical and reflective practitioners, researchers of their own professional life, and agents of change (van Lier, 1994). </p>
<p>In order to make the most of theoretical models and formal research, we must acknowledge the complex relationship between instructional practice and theoretical knowledge. The “theory versus practice” dichotomy is misleading by making teachers assume that instructional practice is entirely removed from formal theory. Theory can be a spark, an irritant, or a guiding force. It cannot be uniformly abstract or distant from the challenges faced by novice or expert teachers. Rather, we should appreciate the enormous practical utility of theoretical models and empirical research.  After all, “There is nothing so practical as good theory ” (Lewin, 1951, p.7). Following Grabe (2001) and Grabe and Kaplan (1996), Hedgcock (2010) proposed the following 8 outputs of the overlapping orientations of contemporary L2 writing theory and research:</p>
<ol>
<li>An account of how writers generate texts and why readers deem texts effective</li>
<li>An explanation of why writing quality varies when context, topic, and task are held constant</li>
<li>An understanding of why some writers produce unsuccessful texts under certain conditions and when assigned specific composing tasks</li>
<li>A characterization of how developmental paths vary under divergent conditions</li>
<li>Criteria for evaluating curricula, instructional methods, and educational outcomes</li>
<li>Frameworks for constructing effective, construct-appropriate writing curricula</li>
<li>Tools for devising productive teaching practices and response methods</li>
<li>Reliable, valid, and fair procedures for assessing written products and writers’ skills</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Fundamentals-of-writing-and-writing-systems"><a href="#Fundamentals-of-writing-and-writing-systems" class="headerlink" title="Fundamentals of writing and writing systems"></a>Fundamentals of writing and writing systems</h2><h3 id="Origins-of-Writing"><a href="#Origins-of-Writing" class="headerlink" title="Origins of Writing"></a>Origins of Writing</h3><p>Writing is old, but the symbol systems or writing systems (scripts) that enable writing to be attached to speech are recent, dating to about 3500 BCE (Powell, 2012). Writing systems are different from pictorial systems/protowriting that do not have writing attached to speech. </p>
<p>Pictorial systems do not require exact representation; images must be clear enough to be recognized as part of a narrative. “There is …a great deal of ambiguity”, partly because symbols do not have to be directly linked to words, morphemes, syllables, or phonemes in any given language (Crystal, 2006, p.109).</p>
<p>There are three categories of protowriting. First, “<u>primitive art</u>“, such as cave paintings of Lascaux in France, petroglyphs in Utah desert and other archaeological sites throughout the world, which can’t be understood anymore. Second, “<u>descriptive-representational device</u>“, pictures that tell the viewers by relying on some convention of figurative art, such as the Narmer Palette in Egypt which demonstrates how ancient Egyptians communicate complex information and tell stories by arrange conventionalized figures systematically. Third, <u>“identifying-mnemonic device”</u>, a forerunner system that clearly establishes a protagonist or event by isolating a conspicuous feature of a person or event. For example, the Winnebago Indians devised a symbol system to keep tracks of songs, which recounted events such as immigrations and battles. </p>
<p>Gradually, symbols can be associated with the sounds of the words that they represented. For example, the Sumerian symbol (glyph) for arrow, realized as [ti] in speech, represented the word for life, <em>til</em>. As more symbol-referent relationships proliferated, a correspondence between symbol and speech was established and enhanced the efficiency of scripts. As many glyphs could be pronounced the same way when representing different words, a system of determinative forms developed. Determinatives can avoid ambiguity by indexing a word’s semantic category and phonetic constituents, showing how to pronounce it, distinguish it from its homophones. In the case of Sumerian cuneiform, which was primarily syllabic, then graphemes were combined to form compounds. Eventually, phrases and clauses were constructed.</p>
<h3 id="Lexigraphic-Writing"><a href="#Lexigraphic-Writing" class="headerlink" title="Lexigraphic Writing"></a>Lexigraphic Writing</h3><p>We can assign scripts to two broad categories, according to the nature of relationship between their symbols and linguistic units that they represent: (1) <em>logographic systems</em> (or logographies), whose inventories contains graphs that represent morphemes, words, and even concept; (2) <em>phonographic</em> (or phonographies) systems, whose inventories contain graphs that represent units of sound, and can be subdivided into two categories: Syllabic orthographies (graphs represents syllables) and alphabetic scripts (graphs represents individual phonemes).</p>
<h4 id="Logographic-writing"><a href="#Logographic-writing" class="headerlink" title="Logographic writing"></a>Logographic writing</h4><p>Chinese (<em>hanzi</em>)         </p>
<p>Knowledge of a particular script can affect the process of learning L2 and a new writing system. For example, a literate Chinese speaker may find it difficult to develop strategies for word analysis in English.</p>
<h4 id="Syllabic-writing"><a href="#Syllabic-writing" class="headerlink" title="Syllabic writing"></a>Syllabic writing</h4><p>Korean (<em>hangul</em>), Mesopotamian, and Egyptian evolved from logographies, with some of their graphemes resembling historical logograms.</p>
<p>Japanese kana, Cherokee, and Tamil associate single graphemes with consonant vowel and consonant-vowel-consonant.</p>
<h4 id="Alphabetic-writing"><a href="#Alphabetic-writing" class="headerlink" title="Alphabetic writing"></a>Alphabetic writing</h4><p>Examples: French, English, Spanish, Greek, Russian, Arabic</p>
<p>Alphasyllabaries/abugidas: Korean hangul and Thai script draw on both syllabic and alphabetic systems.</p>
<h4 id="Transparency-and-the-Orthographic-Depth-Hypothesis"><a href="#Transparency-and-the-Orthographic-Depth-Hypothesis" class="headerlink" title="Transparency and the Orthographic Depth Hypothesis"></a>Transparency and the Orthographic Depth Hypothesis</h4><p>In terms of the comparative transparency (or opacity) - the degree to which they adhere to a one-to-one principle, orthographies are divided into: transparent, opaque, something in between. </p>
<p>Transparent&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Opaque</p>
<p>Korean, Finnish,Turkish&lt;&lt;&lt;Italian, Spanish,Modern Greek &lt;&lt;&lt; German,Swedish&gt;&gt;&gt; Chinese Hanzi</p>
<p>Orthographic Depth Hypothesis (ODH) predicts transparent orthographies induce learners to analyze words (at the intraword level) phonologically when they read (Defior et al., 2002), while learners of opaque orthographies tend to rely more on lexical information specific to individual word forms and less on intraword (morphological) analysis (Dehaene, 2009). </p>
<h2 id="Distinct-dimensions-of-L2-writing-development"><a href="#Distinct-dimensions-of-L2-writing-development" class="headerlink" title="Distinct dimensions of L2 writing development"></a>Distinct dimensions of L2 writing development</h2><p>Developing literacy in languages requires not only orthography but also the social practices and cognitive functions to decode and produce written texts. Writing systems should be learned through socially mediated processes, such as formal instructions, sustained observation, imitation, and practice. This section will examine dimensions of L2 literacy that distinguish L2 literacy development, writing processes, and L2 writers’ texts from L1.</p>
<h3 id="Prior-knowledge-implications-for-teaching-L2-writing"><a href="#Prior-knowledge-implications-for-teaching-L2-writing" class="headerlink" title="Prior knowledge: implications for teaching L2 writing"></a>Prior knowledge: implications for teaching L2 writing</h3><p>The prior experience is a primary feature that distinguishes novice L2 writers from their L1 counterparts. Knowledge about texts, genres, purposes, and their formal properties make up learners’ schematic knowledge. Researchers and theorists have classified schematic knowledge into a number of subcategories, four of which we will discuss here.</p>
<p><em>Content schemata</em>: an individual’s prior knowledge of the ideas in an oral or written text.</p>
<p><em>Cultural schemata</em>: knowledge about culture-specific practices, traditions, relationships, identities, beliefs and values.</p>
<p><em>Formal schemata</em>: knowledge about how texts and speech events are organized</p>
<p><em>Linguistic schemata</em>: knowledge of the morphosyntactic properties and lexical choices associated with particular genres and speech events, and particular topics.</p>
<p> Writing teachers should select reading materials and writing tasks to capitalize on learners’ prior knowledge, activate their existing schemata, and build this schematic knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="Intercultural-rhetoric-and-its-implications-for-teaching-L2-writing"><a href="#Intercultural-rhetoric-and-its-implications-for-teaching-L2-writing" class="headerlink" title="Intercultural rhetoric and its implications for teaching L2 writing"></a>Intercultural rhetoric and its implications for teaching L2 writing</h3><p>The study of intercultural rhetoric (IR) aims to characterize the divergent assumptions and expectations of L2 learners about the rhetorical conventions and social functions of texts, formally called contrastive rhetoric.</p>
<h4 id="The-genesis-of-contrastive-rhetoric"><a href="#The-genesis-of-contrastive-rhetoric" class="headerlink" title="The genesis of contrastive rhetoric"></a>The genesis of contrastive rhetoric</h4><p>As a landmark work in the field of IR, Kaplan’s (1966) work analyzed over 600 paragraph-length writing samples by university ESL students with various L1. This study found that Arabic-speaking writers made extensive use of coordination, to a degree considered excessive by English-speaking academic readers; Chinese and Japanese tended to circle around a topic ar argument, rather than approaching it head-on or introducing an explicit argument. French and Spanish learners often introduced extraneous material more frequently than English-speaking academic writers.</p>
<p>It i important to note that the vast majority of L2 students begin the process of developing L2 writing skills with literate histories that inevitably influence their readiness and awareness, and L2 writing instructors should be sensitive and responsive to the differences across groups.</p>
<h4 id="Controversies-in-CR-IR-research-and-their-impact-on-L2-writing-instruction"><a href="#Controversies-in-CR-IR-research-and-their-impact-on-L2-writing-instruction" class="headerlink" title="Controversies in CR/IR research and their impact on L2 writing instruction"></a>Controversies in CR/IR research and their impact on L2 writing instruction</h4><p>A number of scholars have challenged and even rejected the CR hypothesis that there are strong connections between writers’ cognitive processes and their written output, further charging that CR and IR research has ethnocentric (if not Anglocentric) overtones and contrastive conclusions are often culturally deterministic. State-of-the-art IR research does not presuppose that writers from a given linguistic or cultural background will experience the same challenges in learning a given L2 or undertaking specific writing tasks. Each L2 writer should be viewed in individual terms, not as a prototype representing a set of essentializing collective norms or stereotypes (Kutoba, 2010).</p>
<h2 id="Chapter-summary"><a href="#Chapter-summary" class="headerlink" title="Chapter summary"></a>Chapter summary</h2><p>Apprentice L2 writers are likely to need “more of everything “ in terms of reading skill development, genre awareness, idea generation strategies, planning heuristics, drafting practice, and feedback incorporation techniques than their L1counterparts.</p>

Analyze the section by addressing the prompts below.</p>
<ol>
<li>What context, cultural, and formal schemata does the author or the text likely assume on the part of the reader? Identify features of the text that you think might be culturally embedded and worth of explicit instruction. How might you engage your students in comparing textual content and structure to the content and structure of similar texts in their primary languages?</li>
<li>Consider what you know about your prospective students’ existing schematic knowledge, what steps would you take to bridge their potential knowledge gaps and equip them to maximize their text comprehension? For example, what kinds of assistance with topical knowledge, rhetorical arrangement, challenging grammatical constructions, and unfamiliar vocabulary would you provide?</li>
<li>Devise a simple instructional outline, along with appropriate materials for assisting students with predicting the text’s contexts and structure, understanding and interpreting it, and ultimately responding to it in a writing task or exercise (e.g., a reading journal entry, a reactions statement posted as a blog entry, a critical summary).</li>

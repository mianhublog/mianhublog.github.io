        <p>How many forms of qualitative research are there? Creswell (2013) presents five approaches. Tesch (1990) lists 45 approaches in terms of designs, data analysis, and disciplinary orientation. There is no consensus as to how tp classify the numbers of approaches to qualitative research. In this book, Merriam and Tisdell (2016) choose six commonly used approachs to doing qualitative research.<img src="post5/Screenshot 2021-09-28 at 11.46.05 AM.png" alt="Screenshot 2021-09-28 at 11.46.05 AM" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>
<p>They start from a definition of the basic qualitative study. Qualitative study is based on the belief that knowledge is constructed by people in an ongoing fashion in contrast to the belief that it is pre-existing, and waiting to be discovered. In doing qualitative study, researchers tend to generally describe their research as a qualitative research without mentioning the specific types. Merriam and Tisdell suggest that we can call the type of research a basic qualitative study. The core characteristic of all qualitative research is that individuals construct reality in interaction with their social worlds. Therefore, a qualitative research tend to focus on</p>
<p>(1) how people interpret their experiences</p>
<p>(2) how they construct their worlds</p>
<p>(3) what meaning they attribute to their experiences</p>
<p>The overall purpose to not to find concrete proof or data, but to understand how people make sense of their lives and experiences. The analysis of the data involves identifying recurring patterns that characterize the data. Findings <em>are</em> these recurring patterns or themes supported by the data from which they were derived. The overall interpretation will be the researcher’s understanding of the participants’ understanding of the phenomenon of interest. Which means, even the same research context, partcipants, a different researcher will not not have the same understanding, and research requires researchers to reveal their own positions before presenting their understandings. </p>
<h1 id="PHENOMENOLOGY"><a href="#PHENOMENOLOGY" class="headerlink" title="PHENOMENOLOGY"></a>PHENOMENOLOGY</h1><p>Phenomenology is a study of people’s everyday life and social action. The underlying assumption is that there is an essence or essences to shared experience. Bracketing, analysing and comparing the experiences of different people can identify the essences of phenomenon. For example, the essence of learning, the essence of being a language teacher, the essence of knowledge. Phenomenologists are to depict the essence or basic structure of experience. The phenomenological interview is the primary method of data collection. Before interviewing the participants who have the direct experience, researchers usually explore his or her own experiences to examine dimensions of the experience and become aware of personal prejudices, view points, and assumptions, i.e., the researcher is interested in learner agency, he or she can reflect on the experience of being a learner and the space for their agency. However, this experience itself is evolving and unique for different people. Phenomenological research uses <em>phenomenological reduction</em> to return to the essence of the experience to derive the inner structure or meaning in and of itself. <em>Horizontalization</em> is the process of laying out all the data for examination and treating the data as having equal weight, and <em>Imaginative variation</em> involves viewing the data from various perspectives, seeing different things from different angles. Phenomenological research is well-suited to studying affective, emotional, and intense human experiences.</p>
<h1 id="ERHNOGRAPHY"><a href="#ERHNOGRAPHY" class="headerlink" title="ERHNOGRAPHY"></a>ERHNOGRAPHY</h1><p>The core feature shard by many ethnographic studies is its focus on society and culture. It is even hard to define what culture is. Essentially, it refers to the beliefs, values, and attitudes that structure the behaviour patterns of a specific group of people. As Van Maanen (1982, pp. 103–104) notes: “The result of ethnographic inquiry is cultural description.”  This reminds me of an ethnographic study I have heard via a podcast programme that a researcher actually rent a fish pond to be like a fisherman when studying how fishermen receive the technology promoted the local government. As this chapter says, immersion in the site as a participant observer is the primary method of data collection. Similary, researchers have to describe the cultural practices also depict their understanding of the cultural meaning of the phenomenon. In this case, the researcher who studied fishmen had to describe the fishermen’s experience and also her own understanding of using new teachnology in her own fish pond. </p>
<h1 id="GROUNDED-THEORY"><a href="#GROUNDED-THEORY" class="headerlink" title="GROUNDED THEORY"></a>GROUNDED THEORY</h1><p> Charmaz (2000, p. 511)) articulates why grounded theory was so “revolutionary”:</p>
<p>It challenged</p>
<p>(a) arbitrary divisions between theory and research</p>
<p>(b) views of qualitative research as primarily a precursor to more “rigorous” quantitative methods</p>
<p>(c) claims that the quest for rigor made qualitative research illegitimate</p>
<p>(d) beliefs that qualitative methods are impressionistic and unsystematic,</p>
<p>(e) separation of data collection and analysis</p>
<p>(f) assumptions that qualitative research could produce only descriptive case studies rather than theory development</p>
<p>The focus of grounded theory is building theory. How to build a theory with grounded theory approach. It involves the identification of a <em>core category,</em> which is the main conceptual element through which all other categories and properties are connected. In addition to the core category, the theory consists of other categories, properties, and hypotheses. Categories, and the properties that define or illuminate the categories, are conceptual elements of the theory, all of which are inductively derived from or are “grounded” in the data. Hypotheses are the relationships drawn among categories and properties. These hypotheses are tentative and are derived from the study, rather than pre-established in the quantitative study. </p>
<h1 id="NARRATIVE-STUDY"><a href="#NARRATIVE-STUDY" class="headerlink" title="NARRATIVE STUDY"></a>NARRATIVE STUDY</h1><p>Narratives, or stories are the oldest and most natural form of sense making (Jonassen &amp; Hernandez-Serrano, 2002). Stories are how we make sense of our experiences, how we communicate with others, and through which we understand the world around us. Tsui (2011) uses narratives to explore teachers’ identity formation of an EFL teacher, Minfang. It examines the lived experience of Minfang as an EFL learner and EFL teacher throughout his 6 years of teaching, the processes that were involved as he struggled with multiple identities, the interplay between reification and negotiation of meanings, and the institutional construction and his personal reconstruction of identities. With the growing popularity of narrative study, discussions appear as to how to best tell people’ stories, the role of the researcher in the process, and how trustworthy these narratives are. Are researchers solely listeners or participants also? Do we design semi-structurerd questions before or the story tellers lead the narratives? Can we trust participants’ stories and memories. </p>
<h1 id="QUALITATIVE-CASE-STUDIES"><a href="#QUALITATIVE-CASE-STUDIES" class="headerlink" title="QUALITATIVE CASE STUDIES"></a>QUALITATIVE CASE STUDIES</h1><p>A <em>case study</em> is an in-depth description and analysis of a bounded system. A bounded system means there are boundaries that differentiate the case from others. The case can be a person as a case example of some phenomenon, a program, a group, an institution, a community, or a specific policy, etc. To assess the boundaries of the topic is to ask how finite the data collection would be. In the previous fishermen’s study, the researcher focused on fishmen who chose to adopt the promoted technology in the countryside of China than any fishmen. In this sense, the study is also a case study. </p>
<h1 id="WHEN-THE-TYPES-OF-QUALITATIVE-RESEARCH-OVERLAP"><a href="#WHEN-THE-TYPES-OF-QUALITATIVE-RESEARCH-OVERLAP" class="headerlink" title="WHEN THE TYPES OF QUALITATIVE RESEARCH OVERLAP"></a>WHEN THE TYPES OF QUALITATIVE RESEARCH OVERLAP</h1><p>The types of qualitative research is not limited the the six mentioned in this chapter, and there can be combinations of different approaches, such as ethnographic case study, grounded case study. There is no single right way to define or describe qualitative research, also it is up to the researcher to design a study.</p>
